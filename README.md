# SAGE (IntruSion alert-driven Attack Graph Extractor)
Repository to accompany our publications 

"SAGE: Intrusion Alert-driven Attack Graph Extractor" at VizSec'21, and

"Alert-driven Attack Graph Generation using S-PDFA" at TDSC'21.

## Requires 
- Flexfringe (https://github.com/tudelft-cda-lab/FlexFringe)
- Python packages
  - `graphviz`
  - `requests`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - Mamontenok

**Or you can switch to the `docker` branch for a docker container.**


## Usage
`python sage.py path_to_json_files experiment_name [-h] [-t T] [-w W] [--timerange STARTRANGE ENDRANGE] [--dataset {cptc,other}] [--keep-files]`

Required positional arguments:

* `path_to_json_files`: Directory containing intrusion alerts in json format. `sample-input.json` provides an example of the accepted file format.
> Ideal setting: One json file for each attacker/team. Filename considered as attacker/team label.
* `experiment_name`: Custom name for all artefacts.
> Figures, trace files, model files, attack graphs are saved with this prefix for easy identification.

Options:

* `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message and exit.
* `-t`: Time window in which duplicate alerts are discarded (default: 1.0 sec).
* `-w`: Aggregate alerts occuring in this window as one episode (default: 150 sec).
* `--timerange`: A floating-point tuple limiting the alerts that are parsed and involved in the final attack graphs (default: (0, 100)).
> If not provided, the default values of (0,100) are used, meaning alerts from 0-th to 100-th hour (relative to the start of the alert capture) are parsed.
* `--dataset`: The name of the dataset with the alerts (default: other, available options: cptc, other).
> Since the IP addresses of the attackers are known for the CPTC dataset, irrelevant alerts are filtered out.
* `--keep-files`: Do not delete the dot files after the program ends.
> By default, the generated dot files with the attack graphs are deleted. They might, however, be useful for analytics or testing.

Examples:

* Run SAGE with the default parameters on the CPTC-2017 dataset: `python sage.py alerts/cptc-2017/ exp-2017 --dataset cptc`
* Run SAGE with the time window of 2.0 seconds and the alert aggregation window of 200 seconds on the CPTC-2018 dataset: `python sage.py alerts/cptc-2018/ exp-2018 -t 2.0 -w 200 --dataset cptc`
* Run SAGE on the CCDC dataset and do not delete the dot files (you can omit `--dataset other`): `python sage.py alerts/ccdc/ exp-ccdc --dataset other --keep-files`

Tip: in case you often use the same non-default values, you can create an alias (e.g `alias sage="python sage.py -t 1.5 --dataset cptc --keep-files"` and then run `sage alerts/cptc-2017/ exp-2017`)

## First time use

- In `sage.py`, set paths to `flexfringe/` executable, and `path_to_ini` variable.
- A sample alert file is provided with the name `sample-input.json` (T5 alerts from CPTC-2018) to test SAGE. Use the following command: 

`python sage.py alerts/ firstExp`

where `alerts/` contains `sample-input.json`. For other options, see Usage section above.
