# Compares two AGs based on the nodes and edges that they have (presumably, AGs generated by the original and modified algorithms respectively).
#
# If two .dot files with AGs are provided, then they are compared with each other.
#   - If running in quiet mode (i.e. option -q , inspired by the "quick diff"), the script:
#       - Prints that the graphs are different if at least one node or edge has been found by only one of the algorithms (exit code 1)
#       - Prints nothing if there are no nodes or edges found by only one of the algorithms (exit code 0)
#   - If running in normal mode (i.e. with no options), then stats generated by `diff-nodes.sh` and `diff-edges.sh` are printed.
# If two directories are provided, then every pair of corresponding AGs is compared against each other (recursively).
#   - The AGs that are different are reported.
#   - To count the number of different AGs in the input directories, pipe the output to `wc` command (e.g. `./diff-ags.sh orig-2017AGs/ merged-sinks-2017AGs/ | wc -l`).
#   - NB! Only the AGs present in both directories are compared. The ones that are present only in one of the directories are ignored.
#
# Note: The comparison is purely based on the node and edges of the graphs (their names and labels, to be precise).
#       See also comments for `diff-nodes.sh` and `diff-edges.sh`.
#
# NB! This script assumes that the directory with the AGs has the name ExpNameAGs/ and that the AG files also have ExpName in their name (i.e. the name has not been changed).
#     To avoid potential errors, please only use alphanumeric characters in the name of the experiments (i.e. no whitespaces, enters etc.).
#
# NB! This script is based on .dot files, which are by default deleted during the execution of SAGE.
#      To prevent the deletion, use the --keep-files option when running SAGE.
